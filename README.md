ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NgTiennDat
I am a full-stack software engineer and writer. I love programming, reading, writing, and speaking.
As a software engineer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, and my unequivocal love for making things that change the world.
That's why I like to make things that make a difference.
